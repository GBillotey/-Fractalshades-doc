# Fractalshades-doc

Repository for Fractalshades documentation deployment (view it at https://gbillotey.github.io/Fractalshades-doc/)

  - branch `doc_latest` deploys the html documentation files
  - branch `doc_latest_data` stores the last generated examples, for the next doc build only the one with updated scripts will be re-run.

Note: these branches are auto-generated from Fractashades `doc-deploy` workflow.
